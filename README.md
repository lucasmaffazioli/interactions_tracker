# Interactions tracker

This app was an idea I had to help a friend of my with social anxiety, a tool to gauge progress of putting yourself out here.

This Flutter app sets objectives to interact with more people, allows you to track the interactions and the quality of them. The items which you can track are 100% customizable.
